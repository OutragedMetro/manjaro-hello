<big>Manjaro 18.0</big>

We are happy to publish another stable release of Manjaro Linux, we call Illyria.

The Xfce edition remains our flagship offering and has received the attention it deserves. Few can claim to offer such a polished, integrated and leading-edge Xfce experience. We ship Xfce 4.13 with this release of Manjaro. 

We mainly focused on polishing the user experience on the desktop and window manager, and on updating some components to take advantage of newly available technologies such as switching to a new theme we call Adapta-Maia. The new feature Display-Profiles allows you to store one or more profiles for a particular display configuration that you may be using. To make the deal a little sweeter we implemented auto-applying of profiles when new displays are connected.

Our KDE edition continues to deliver this powerful, mature and feature-rich desktop environment with a unique look-and-feel, and with the perks of Manjaro's latest tools. We ship now Plasma 5.14 desktop in combination with the latest KDE-Apps 18.08. There's a new Display Configuration widget for screen management which is useful for presentations. Switching primary monitor when plugging in or unplugging monitors is now smoother. The Network widget now works for SSH VPN tunnels again. The Audio Volume widget now has a built in speaker test feature moved from Phonon settings and Plasma now warns on logout when other users are logged in.

Kernel 4.19 LTS is used for this release, such as the latest drivers available to date. Relative to the last installation media release, our tools have been improved and polished.

The Manjaro Settings Manager (MSM) now provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for installing and removing the many series of kernels we offer. Manjaro's selection of readily available kernels remains the most extensive of all Linux distribution we know of. At the time of this release, eight kernel-series are available directly from our binary repositories, ranging from the mature &amp; rock-solid 3.16 series to the latest 4.19 release. Additionally we offer three realtime kernel series. Such a wide array of available kernel options results in extensive hardware support, getting the most out of your system for you, be it old or new.

With Pamac v7.2 we fixed known issues and added new functions. Followed features you can expect:

    - pamac-gtk: add edit build files support
    - pamac-cli: add edit build files support
    - pamac-cli: add clone action
    - pamac-cli: build action now has an --no-clone option to only use local build files
    - pamac-cli: build action without argument now tries to build from the PKGBUILD in the current dir
    - pamac-cli: added a CLI mode to pamac, which acts similar to apt-get

With Manjaro Hello we added new functions. Followed features you can expect:

    - you can now maintain suggested packages by the community directly in the welcome screen under the applications option
    - UI enhancements
    - updated translations

We hope you enjoy this release and let us know what you think of Illyria.
